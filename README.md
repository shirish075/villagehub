# 🌍 VillageHub - Empowering Villages with Smart Problem Reporting

### 📌 About VillageHub
**VillageHub** is a simple yet powerful web application designed to help villagers report local issues efficiently. Whether it's a broken streetlight, a pothole, or any other civic problem, villagers can take a photo and upload it to the respective department. The concerned authorities can then take action and update the status by uploading a resolved image. The village head (*Sarpanch*) has an admin view to oversee the resolution process.
